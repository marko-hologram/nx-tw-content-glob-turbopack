# Reproduction for Nx Tailwind content glob pattern issue when using Turbopack

Small NX monorepo used to reproduce the issue that happens when using Next.js Turbopack and Tailwind content glob patterns generated by NX.

Explanation for different patterns are in `tailwind.config.js` file.

## Steps to reproduce

1. run the app using
```sh
npx nx dev nx-tailwind
```
2. notice how "My Test Component" on the screen has a purple background using `bg-indigo-400` class
3. open `packages/test/src/lib/test.tsx` file
4. change that class to `bg-indigo-900` (or any background color class)
5. notice how the element doesn't have a background color anymore because that class wasn't generated
6. putting `bg-indigo-400` class back works because CSS file wasn't re-generated and that class is still there
